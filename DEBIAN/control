Description: Keyboard-driven terminal file navigator and launcher
 Sodalite is a keyboard-driven terminal file navigator and launcher. 
 It's designed to be the missing glue for those who usethe shell as their daily driver and seek more speed and ease.
 In a nutshell, sodalite assigns a key to each entry. Pressing a key navigates to the corresponding entry. The assignments are permanent but can be changed to your liking.
 .
  Next to fast navigation, sodalite brings file preview with syntax highlighting and a pluggable hook system.
